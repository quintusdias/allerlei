I would like to state my interest in the Data Engineer, Business Intelligence
position.  My current position at NOAA has me dealing with a multitude of
data sources and log files, requiring continual transformations of data in 
order to find signal within the noise. 

Since 2015, I have primarily been working in two projects at NOAA, 
\href{https://nowcoast.noaa.gov}{\texttt{nowCOAST}}
and
\href{https://idpgis.ncep.noaa.gov}{\texttt{IDP-GIS}}.
These application sit on top of ESRI's ArcGIS Server platform and provide
realtime GIS data to the public.  My role has been 24x7 monitoring of the
applications, which involves writing Big Brother scripts written in Python
to inform operational
personnel of aberrent conditions.  The monitoring scripts often have to talk
to the backend database, which is PostgreSQL.
For the last few months, however, I've been working with more applications
within NOAA than just 
\href{https://nowcoast.noaa.gov}{\texttt{nowCOAST}}
and
\href{https://idpgis.ncep.noaa.gov}{\texttt{IDP-GIS}}.

At times it seems like my entire day is spent manipulating data
with sed, grep, awk, cut, sort, etc.  This comes about primarily in trying
to find patterns in Apache logs.  I regularly sample current
operating conditions, storing the results in SQLite, CSV, or even 
pandas HDFStore files
for later analysis, usually using python/pandas.  And finally, both
nowCOAST and IDP-GIS ingest their data from a variety of sources,
which requires having good communication channels with the upstream
stewards of those data sources.

Thank you for your consideration and I hope to hear from you.
