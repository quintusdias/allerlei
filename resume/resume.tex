\makelettertitle

I would like to place my name into consideration for the software
support engineer position at the Kavli Institute.  I have followed
the events and discoveries of the Kepler Space Telescope over the
last few years with great interest and would be thrilled to contribute
to TESS.

Python has become my language of choice over the last few years and
I use it in most of my GitHub projects, but I also have a long
history with MATLAB.  In 2007, I joined the Image and Scientific
Data Formats team at the MathWorks, becoming  team lead after one
year.  This give me a broad experience with a variety of open source
image and scientific data formats and APIs, ranging from older
‚Äúclassic‚Äù formats such as JPEG, FITS, TIFF, and HDF4, to newer and
more complex formats such as JPEG2000, HDF5, and of course netCDF.
In fact, my first assignment at MathWorks was to implement official
netCDF support in MATLAB, and this was largely based upon the earlier
netCDF community project on SourceForge, MEXCDF, to which I was the
prime contributor.   I also authored the R2011a ‚Äúhigh-level‚Äù HDF5
interface for MATLAB while continuing to refactor and performance-tune
the existing ‚Äúlow-level‚Äù HDF5 interface.

Working at the MathWorks was a good experience in software engineering
practices such as continuous integration, refactoring, requirements
gathering, functional design, design reviews including test plans,
and long-range planning as the team lead.   There were not too many
opportunities for conferences, but for six years I did attend the
NASA/HDF Spring Workshop as MathWorks‚Äô representative, where I
became well-acquainted with the people of the HDF5 Group.

Before coming to the MathWorks, I was at the School for Marine
Sciences at Rutgers University where I was responsible for managing
a small cluster used for running physical oceanographic models
(ROMS).  This required managing  netCDF output files, providing
general software support, usually in MATLAB but also in shell
scripting, maintaining a THREDDS/OpENDAP server, and general Linux
system administration.

Thank you for your consideration.  Please do not hesitate to contact
me if you require any further information.
