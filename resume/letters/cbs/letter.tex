I would like to place my name into consideration for the 
Data Scientist - Data Engineer position
(REF 32836).
Although most of my work experience has been more on the IT side of
scientific institutions, I'm a quick learner and feel I have a great
deal to offer.

Python became my language of choice over the last few years and was
my primary tool working in GIS Dissemination at the National Weather
Service (and thank you for strongly stating Python 3 in the job description).  This involved such tasks as analyzing Apache log files,
writing monitoring scripts, running JMeter load tests, and more, all in
support of monitoring the 24/7 operation of \href{https://nowcoast.noaa.gov}{nowCOAST}
and \href{https://idpgis.ncep.noaa.gov}{IDP-GIS}.  These are web GIS systems backed by ingest, postgresql database, and application server clusters.  During the month of January 2019, nowCOAST
recorded nearly 371 million hits and delivered more than 14 TB of weather data.
Since leaving NWS, I've recently been bolstering my data science / machine learning
credentials through online courses at EdX, which has emphasized Python and Spark.

I also have a long history with MATLAB.  In 2007, I joined the Image
and Scientific Data Formats team at the MathWorks, becoming  team
lead after one year.  This give me a broad experience with a variety
of open source image and scientific data formats and APIs, ranging
from older “classic” formats such as JPEG, FITS, TIFF, and HDF4,
to newer and more complex formats such as JPEG2000 and HDF5/netCDF.
In fact, my first assignment at MathWorks was to implement official
netCDF support in MATLAB, and this was largely based upon the earlier
netCDF community project on SourceForge, MEXCDF, to which I was the
prime contributor.   I also authored the R2011a “high-level” HDF5
interface for MATLAB while continuing to refactor and performance-tune
the existing “low-level” HDF5 interface.

Working at the MathWorks was a good experience in software engineering
practices such as continuous integration, refactoring, requirements
gathering, functional design, design reviews including test plans,
and long-range planning as the team lead.   There were not too many
opportunities for conferences, but for six years I did attend the
NASA/HDF Spring Workshop as MathWorks’ representative, where I
became well-acquainted with the people of the HDF5 Group.

Thank you for your consideration.  Please do not hesitate to contact
me if you require any further information.
